# Git basics

Git is a version control system that helps you track changes, collaborate safely, and roll back when needed.

Quick cheats:
- `git status` — see what changed
- `git add` — stage changes
- `git commit` — save a snapshot
- `git push` — send commits to GitHub
- `git pull` — get updates from remote
